bibere
======

This is a library to maintain a database of publications, currently backed by json files. The main purpose is to allow output to various formats: BibTex for citations/resumes, HTML for webpages, Markdown for whatever people use Markdown for, and Json for everything else.

Current set of features:
- Read and write authors, papers, and venues in human-editable json files
- HTML generator: write out publications in a classed-up html, that can be beautified using CSS.
- BibTex generator: writes out publications as @inproceedings with the basic fields

Coming soon:
- BibTex: support more publication formats
- Markdown/Text generator
- make initialization easier using existing BibTex
